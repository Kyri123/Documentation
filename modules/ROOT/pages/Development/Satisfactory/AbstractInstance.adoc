= Abstract Instance

Coffee Stain created the Abstract Instance system
as a way to reduce the amount of UObjects that static buildings take up and improve performance.
The base game uses this system for walls, foundations, and more,
with plans to expand it according to Ben.

The abstract instance system can be used for any building component that doesn't require gameplay interaction,
and Ben states that almost everything that is static can utilize the system, in theory.

== Working with Abstract Instances

Since Abstract Instances work differently from other actors,
you may need to adapt your code to respond to and interact with them.
For example, if you perform a Line Trace for Actors and hit an abstract instance,
the hit actor will be the Abstract Instance Manager,
which is a singleton that manages all abstract instances,
instead of the building itself.

In order to get the actual building from the hit result,
you must call the Abstract Instance Manager's "Resolve Hit" method,
supplying the hit structure from the trace (or whatever else you're using).

== Creating Your Own Abstract Instances

You can make use of the abstract instance system for your own modded buildings to improve performance.

In order to set up your buildable for abstract instances,
edit the following properties on your buildable:

1. Enable `mCanContainLightweightInstances`
2. Add an Abstact Instance Data Object to `mInstanceData`
3. Create a new array element in the data object
4. Set the Static Mesh accordingly
5. Set `Num Custom Data Floats` to 20

A building can have multiple abstract instance meshes via multiple array elements.
You may also find the following properties useful:

* Use Relative Transform to apply a transform this specific mesh relative to the overall building.
* If the building has no components set `mContainsComponents` on the buildable to false
* The "apply random offset" properties can be used to mitigate z-fighting issues when multiple copies of the building overlap.
